# Ecommerce Customer Spending Prediction - Linear Regression Project

This project explores how customer behavior affects yearly spending using **Linear Regression**. The dataset is from a fictional e-commerce company based in New York that sells clothing online and provides in-store stylist advice.

---

## Objective

The goal is to predict **Yearly Amount Spent** by customers based on various features such as:

- Average Session Length  
- Time on App  
- Time on Website  
- Length of Membership  

This helps the company decide whether to focus more on their **mobile app** or **website**.

## ML Technique Used

- **Supervised Learning**
- **Algorithm**: Linear Regression
- **Evaluation**: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² Score

## Dataset Features

| Feature               | Description                               |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Avg. Session Length   | Average session time on the website       |
| Time on App           | Time spent on mobile app                  |
| Time on Website       | Time spent on website                     |
| Length of Membership  | Customer's membership duration in years   |
| Yearly Amount Spent   | Target variable - money spent in a year   |
| Email, Address, Avatar| Ignored for training                      |

## Key Findings

- Strong correlation between **Length of Membership** and **Yearly Spending**
- Mobile App usage impacts spending more than Website usage
- Linear Regression gives high accuracy with minimal error
